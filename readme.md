One functional requirement I would like to improve on is displaying more information when the search is unsuccessful. At the moment, when the user enters fields that result in nothing, the webpage displays a blank page. This is frustrating for the user because they do not necessarily know if the error was due to their inputs or on the server side. It would be much more useful for new users and all users in general, if the webpage could provide a message/popup indicating that no entries were found. 

One non-functional requirement I would like to improve on is usability. I think a lot of the search functionalities are not intuitive and unclear. For example, I don’t think many students search by course levels when finding courses. Additionally, I think there should be another field to search by course code because some students might already have some courses in mind. The “Search Terms” field currently is very limited and only accepts certain keywords. It would be more user-friendly if it allowed for typos or a larger range of words. I think having more search functionalities such as searching by course code and also less strict filtering on the “Search Terms” field will make the webpage more usable.
